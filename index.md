# Parwiz Khan  
## AI Engineer  
### CS Student UCSD  

## Bio section  

**Coding since high school**  

*Started out with C++*  

~Because I know C++, I can learn other languages much faster~  

**I worked with _two startups_ as an intern**  

***I have real world and academic experience to be a successful AI Engineer***  

***I believe I am good with <sub>people</sub> which gives me a slight advantage over<ins>other <sup>people</sup></ins> who are not good with people***  


*As I sometimes say:*  

>Its better to be good with people than not to be.  



**My favorite langauge is Python  because of its simplicity**  

```
print("hello")
```  


**Here is the same thing in c++**  

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout<<"hello"<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
